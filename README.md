# TicTacToeProdigy
This project was created for personal challenge purpose. The idea was to create a tictactoe game and a IA to play it.

# First Version
The first version of this project was a personal challenge, and it was programmed using logic only. No algorithms such as minimax were used in this version. The main idea of this version was to see what i could make just with logical thinking and my current coding experience.
